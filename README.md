# rock-paper-scissors

## Description
This is a rock, paper, scissors game with a UI added to it that I made while self-learning programming through a website called The Odin Project and this was one of the assignments. This game is played until either the player or computer reaches a score of 5 points and whoever gets to 5 points first wins. Through making this, I learned how to use a mixture of html, css, and javascript to make my projects more interactive. I added buttons that are clickable so the player does not actually have to type in anything and added a restart button so the user doesn't have to manually refresh the page. I also made it so that once either the player or computer reaches 5 points, the buttons will no longer be clickable to indicate that the game is over. Through making this, I mainly practiced how to manipulate the DOM and use events, such as the click function. This project was a good opportunity for me to put my theoretical knowledge of javascript into practice.
